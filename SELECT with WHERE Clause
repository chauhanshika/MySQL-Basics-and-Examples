The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specific condition
WHERE allows you to retrieve only the rows that match a given condition.
You can use operators like =, >, <, >=, <=, !=, and logical operators like AND, OR, NOT.

Examples:

-- Select all employees with salary greater than 50000
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000;

-- Select employees from department 'IT'
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';

-- Select employees with salary more than 40000 and in HR department
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 40000 AND Department = 'HR';

-- Select employees not in Finance department
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department != 'Finance';
