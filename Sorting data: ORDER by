Sorting Data (ORDER BY):
ORDER BY is used to arrange the result in ascending or descending order.
By default, sorting is ascending (ASC).

Examples:

1. Sort by age (ascending)
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age ASC;


2. Sort by age (descending)
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;


3. Sort by name (Aâ€“Z)
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY student_name ASC;


4. Sort by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC, student_name ASC;
