A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
Helps to get related data from multiple tables in a single query.
Tables in a database are often related (e.g., Employees and Departments).
JOINs allow you to connect these tables using a common column like dept_id.
Always use ON to specify the matching condition.

example:
SELECT Employees.name, Departments.department_name
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments
ON Employees.dept_id = Departments.id;
