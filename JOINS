A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.


Types of Joins:

INNER JOIN – returns only matching rows from both tables.
             SELECT e.name, d.department_name
             FROM employees e
             INNER JOIN departments d
             ON e.dept_id = d.id;


LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN) – returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

             SELECT e.name, d.department_name
             FROM employees e
             LEFT JOIN departments d
             ON e.dept_id = d.id;


RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN) – returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

             SELECT e.name, d.department_name
             FROM employees e
             RIGHT JOIN departments d
             ON e.dept_id = d.id;


FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN) – returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

             SELECT e.name, d.department_name
             FROM employees e
             FULL JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.id;
