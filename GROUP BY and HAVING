1. GROUP BY is used to group rows that have the same values in one or more columns.
   GROUP BY works with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN().

2. HAVING is used to filter groups, similar to WHERE but for aggregated data.
   HAVING filters after grouping.

-- Count number of employees in each department
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;

-- Count employees in departments having more than 2 employees
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

-- Average salary per department
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
