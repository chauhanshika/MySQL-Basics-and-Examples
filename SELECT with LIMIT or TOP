LIMIT (in MySQL, PostgreSQL) or TOP (in SQL Server) is used to fetch a specific number of rows from the result set.

Useful when you want only a part of the data.
Often used with ORDER BY to get top salaries, newest records, etc.


:::EXAMPLES

-- MySQL / PostgreSQL: Get first 5 employees
SELECT * FROM Employees
LIMIT 5;

-- SQL Server: Get first 5 employees
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Employees;

-- Get top 3 highest paid employees
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
