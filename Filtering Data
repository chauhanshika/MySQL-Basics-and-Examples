The WHERE clause is used to select only the rows that meet certain conditions.

Examples:

1. Filter by value
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;


2. Filter by text
SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_name = 'Anshika';


3. Using AND / OR
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20 AND student_name = 'Rahul';
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age < 22 OR student_name = 'Priya';


4. Using NOT
SELECT * FROM students WHERE NOT age = 21;
